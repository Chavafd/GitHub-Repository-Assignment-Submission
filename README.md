PacMen Exercise
Description of Project:
This project allows users to create and animate PacMan figures on a web page. Each time you click the "Add PacMan" button, a new PacMan is added to the screen with a random position and velocity. Clicking the "Start Game" button animates the PacMen, making them move around the screen.

How to Run:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the Index.html file in a web browser.
Click on the "Add PacMan" button to add PacMan figures to the screen.
Click on the "Start Game" button to animate the PacMen.
Roadmap of Future Improvements:
Add the ability for PacMen to change direction upon collision with the screen edges.
Introduce different PacMan images or animations to add variety to the game.
Incorporate user-adjustable game settings, such as PacMan speed or size.

Eye Exercise
Description of Project:
The Eye Exercise project displays a pair of eyes on a web page that follows the movement of the mouse cursor. As users move their cursor around the screen, the pupils (eyeballs) adjust their position to "look" at the cursor, creating an interactive visual effect.

How to Run:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the indexSolution.html file in a web browser.
Move your mouse cursor around the screen to see the eyes follow its movement.
Roadmap of Future Improvements:
Introduce the ability to change the eye and pupil colors through user input.
Add more interactive elements, such as blinking or different eye expressions.
Enhance responsiveness for different screen sizes and devices.

Real Time Bus Tracker
Description of Project:
The "Real Time Bus Tracker" project showcases an interactive map that visualizes the bus stops between MIT and Harvard. Upon clicking a button, a marker animates through the bus stops, giving users a visual representation of the route.

How to Run:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the Index.html file in a web browser.
Click on the button labeled "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" to see the marker move through the bus stops.
Roadmap of Future Improvements:
Integrate real-time data to display actual bus locations and timings.
Enhance the visual representation with additional information about each bus stop.
Provide user options to view different routes or set preferences.
